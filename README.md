Hello there! My name is Tully! I am a Junior in High School who is super excited about code! I mostly know java, however am working a little bit in javascript and understand a little bit of python. 
Some things I have made are:
Discord bots using python and discord.py
pure java applications using Java swing
processing, which is a visual library for Java
Minecraft fabric mods in Java

I am also working on the backend of https://pmpkin.app/
  Currently working on push notifications
