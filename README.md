Hello there! My name is Tully! I just graduated High School and am heading to UCSC for CS! I am super excited about code!
My coolest projects that i've done have been:
Github.com/TullyE/ArduinoWOL <-- has a beautiful readme and incredible documentation
Github.com/TullyE/PhysicsSimulation <-- I made for my physics class and it's pretty cool. Physics is hard man
